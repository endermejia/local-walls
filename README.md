# CLIMBEAST

A modern climbing guide application built with Angular 20 that helps climbers discover and navigate climbing locations.
The app features an interactive map interface for exploring climbing spots, detailed route information, and mobile-friendly design.
It uses server-side rendering (SSR) for improved performance and SEO, and implements a fully reactive architecture with Angular Signals for state management.

## Features

- 🗺️ Interactive map with climbing locations
- 📱 Mobile-first responsive design
- 🚀 Fast loading with SSR and lazy loading
- 🔍 Search and filter climbing spots
- 📍 Geolocation support
- 🌐 Multilingual support
- 📶 Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline support

## Tech Stack

- [Angular 20](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
  - SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
  - Zoneless change detection
  - Signals for state management
- [Taiga UI](https://taiga-ui.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (PostgreSQL + Auth + RLS)

## Next Steps

- **El admin debe poder hacer Sync del area con 8a.nu, actualizando los crags y routes**
- **Tanto sync como import deben traer tambien los datos de boulders y no solo sportclimbing**

## Future Features

- **8a.nu Integration**:
  - Copy 8a.nu ascents database.
  - Direct data import using 8a.nu user credentials.
- **Full Offline Support & Service Worker Configuration**:
  - Optimize `ngsw-config.json` for aggressive caching of core app assets.
  - Implement an `OfflineService` to track connectivity and notify users.
  - Develop a data persistence strategy (e.g., IndexedDB) for offline route browsing and ascent logging.
  - Implement Background Sync for queued offline actions (likes, comments, ascents).
  - Enable map tile caching for offline navigation in climbing areas.

## Navigation

The application uses a responsive navigation system that adapts to the device's screen size. On desktop, it features a collapsible sidebar, while on mobile, it transitions to a bottom navigation bar.

### Core Sections

- **🏠 Home**: Personalized dashboard with recent activity and updates.
- **🗺️ Explore**: Interactive map for discovering climbing spots with advanced filtering (grade, style, shade, etc.).
- **📜 Areas**: A comprehensive list view of all climbing areas for quick access.
- **⚙️ Admin / My Areas**: Management panel for administrators and equippers to curate crag data.
- **👤 User Profile**: Access to your logbook, personal statistics, and account settings.

### Content Hierarchy

- **Area Details**: Overview of a climbing region, including its crags and general info.
- **Crag Details**: Detailed view of a specific sector, featuring route lists, grade charts, and approach info.
- **Topo Viewer**: Interactive topo images with route overlays for precise navigation.
- **Route Details**: Technical specifications, grade distribution, and user ascent history.

## PWA & Service Worker

The app is configured as a PWA using Angular Service Worker. It provides:

- Offline caching of the app shell and static assets.
- Installable manifest for mobile and desktop.
